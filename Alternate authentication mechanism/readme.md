## DETAILED DESCRIPTION

Alternate authentication mechanism for digital payments. (internet and mobile payments)


Presently, most of the digital payments are authenticated by a Personal Identification Number(PIN)/password/CVV 
followed by a One-Time Password (OTP) which is received by the remitter over his mobile phone. 

While the SMS through which the OTP is received is not an encrypted secure messaging system, 
the instances of digital payment frauds where the users are tricked into sharing the OTP have also been observed. 

As such, an alternate smart secure authentication mechanism may result in more secure digital transactions.
